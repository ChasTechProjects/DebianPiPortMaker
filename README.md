# DebianPiPortMaker
Semi-automated creation of ARM64 Debian images for the Raspberry Pi.

DebianPiPortMaker is a semi-automated script allowing for creation of ARM64 Debian images for Raspberry Pi models supportive of this architecture. The script can create fully functional Debian images giving a similar experience to Debian that you install on your x86 PC.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:

-Bluetooth support.
-ARMv7 32-bit version for the Pi 2.
-Use of the generic kernel (ARM64 only) and GRUB2.
